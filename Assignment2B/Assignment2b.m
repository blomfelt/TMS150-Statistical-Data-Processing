% Find the maximum likelihood estimate mu_hat and beta_hat of mu and beta
% using the given data, and using such estimates show that the plot of
% corresponding pdf adapts well to the empirical distribution of the data.
% (for the latter you can use the 'histogram' function, using an
% appropriate 'Normalization' option for suitable comparison with the pdf.

% "The significant wave height is the average height of the highest
% one-third of all measured waves, which is equivalent to the estimate that
% would be made by a visual observer at sea."

% The data-file contain a collection of significant-wave-heights computed
% in different periods.
% The data file is named 'atlantic.txt'
wavedata = readtable("atlantic.txt", "LeadingDelimitersRule","ignore");
wavedata = table2array(wavedata);

% To find the maximum likelihood estimates of mu and beta from the data:
out = evfit(-wavedata); % Flipping the sign
mu_hat = -out(1); % Flipping the sign of mu est. to be compatible with eq 1
beta_hat = out(2);
% The maximum likelihood estimate of mu and beta are therefore mu_hat and
% beta_hat

% Limits chosen based on histogram of the dataset
x = 0:0.01:14;
% Generate the pdf for the plotting
f = 1/beta_hat .* exp(-1*(x-mu_hat)/beta_hat).*exp(-1*exp(-1*(x-mu_hat)/beta_hat));

% Based on question b), we wish to advise the mayor of a nearby city on
% building a wall which protects from even the highest wave, how high
% should this wall be?
max(max_x)
% 25.9068
% But the wall should be higher, as high as possible 
% Using B = 1 000 000, the maximum wave height is 32.7234 feet
% Since the probability of a larger wave than the current maximum wave
% height gets smaller the larger the current maximum wave height gets (the
% area for the density function above the current maximum wave height),
% there is a possibility, with an infinite amount of waves, of an even
% larger wave than the one mentioned here, and in fact the waves may get
% infinitely high, but the probability of it would also be very very small.
% I would advise the mayor to build the wall at least 35 feet high, since
% this would protect from the highest wave we saw during the million
% repeats.
