# We can use the "$" to extract information from R "objects"

# suppose for whatever reason you wish to fit a model on the
# data except for observation in row 5.
# method 1:
m_without_5 <- lm(dist~speed, data = cars[-5,]) # notice we used the data option and asked to ignore the 5th row
# method 2:
data_without_5 <- cars[-5,]  # create a subset without row 5
m_without_5 <- lm(data_without_5$dist~data_without_5$speed)  # we used the $ to make sure to use the right dataset

# Warning: the following would NOT work
attach(m_without_5)
lm(dist~speed)  # this gives the estimates based on the full dataset as for R dist and speed are from the first dataset (the full one).
                # the previous "attach" function did not overwrite the initial one.
# So, all in all, if you plan to use different datasets, either use the $ to make sure you
# use the right data (as in method 2), or use the "data = ... " option in lm() as in method 1
